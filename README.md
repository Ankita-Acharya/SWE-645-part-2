# About this repository


This was to create an MVC-based Web application using JSF2 framework/PrimeFaces and use JPA/Hibernatealong with Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) to persist and read data to/from a relational database. The application allows to fill out a survey form to provide feedback about their campus visit. It also allows users to view all surveys recorded to date. The application starts with a welcome homepage, which in essence has two links: 1) A Survey, which allows a prospective student to fill out a survey form, and 2) List All Surveys, which allows a user to view all surveys done to date. This is developed as a dynamic web project in Eclipse and is deployed as a part of a war file on Tomcat platform. I used the Amazon EC2 instance with the Tomcat application server  to deploy your war file.
